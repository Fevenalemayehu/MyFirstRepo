Brief Introduction About Myself
Hello! My name is Feven Alemayehu, and I'm excited to begin my journey with Git and GitHub. 
I'm currently learning version control to better manage my coding projects and collaborate with others. 
Technology has always fascinated me, and I'm particularly interested in  web development.

I created this repository as part of my GitHub learning process. Through this platform, I hope to contribute to meaningful projects while improving my programming skills. 
When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading. I believe continuous learning is key to growth, and I'm thrilled to be taking these first steps in my developer journey!
